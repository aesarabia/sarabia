        <h2>After school Programs</h2>
        <p>Since 2009, CPNYC has provided structured after-school programs to over 200 elementary and middle school aged children, Monday through Friday, 3:00-6:30pm. Program services include comprehensive academic support, enrichment activities, mentoring and mental health services. Our After school Program is designed to develop children’s intellectual, social and emotional competencies and promote healthy decision making and critical thinking skills.  Our staff training combines the best practices in youth development with mental health strategies and techniques that specifically address the unique needs of these children. This is a bold new approach toward engaging children of imprisoned parents in an authentic empowering environment.</p>
